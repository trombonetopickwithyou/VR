# Joshua Williams - CS5331 (VR at Texas Tech University)
## Project 1: How has COVID-19 affected you?

Project 1 focuses on creating a human scale scene experienced from the 'inside out'.
This project is an opportunity to design and express how COVID-19 has affected our lives. 
Specifically, this project focuses on the environments which have changed due to the Covid-19.
The VR environment must include objects and be decorated in some kind of a consistent style. The environment should also be explorable.
